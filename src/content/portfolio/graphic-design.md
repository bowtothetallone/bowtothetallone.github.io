# GlyMed Plus
## Rebrand
While at GlyMed Plus, I was tasked with rebranding our product lines. I updated each label and box for the 100+ products that they offer. Additionally, I updated all web and print assets with our new branding imagery.

## Tradeshow Graphics
We launched a few different tradeshow booth designs while I worked for GlyMed Plus. Among other projects, I updated our pop up banners that accompanied our trade show booths to match our 25 year anniversary branding, and designed our 2015 tradeshow booth from the ground up.

## Social Media Graphics
My team and I launched several new products for GlyMed Plus. I designed a variety of social media content for those products, and also created accompanying video content which can be <a href="https://jfcgallery.com/portfolio/video/">found at this link</a>.
