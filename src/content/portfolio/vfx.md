# Evil Eye Pictures
After receiving my Bachelors degree in Animation and Visual Effects, I started my career with Evil Eye Pictures in San Francisco and at Rhythm & Hues in Los Angeles. Between the two studios I worked on 7 feature films, primarily in camera tracking and scene layout roles. Here's a brief sample of some of that work.
