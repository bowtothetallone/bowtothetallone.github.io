# Resilient Hope
I am an alumni of Columbine High School and survived the tragedy that occurred there in April of 1999. In the years after, I gathered a few friends to film our stories, in the hopes of providing some comfort for others who have experienced public violence. Here is the project's href="https://www.youtube.com/@1resilienthope">YouTube channel.</a>

# LDS Walk With You
I worked with a small team of 4 to interview dozens of affirming families of LGBT children who came from an LDS heritage from 2014 to 2017. I edited our trailer and the majority of content on LDS Walk With You's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ldswalkwithyou">Youtube Channel</a>.
